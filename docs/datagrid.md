# Data Grid

`DataGridControl` allows you to display data from any data source in a column and row format. It provides high-performance data shaping and rich editing functionality. The control supports data sorting and grouping by any number of columns. The built-in auto-filter row and search panel allows a user to quickly locate data. You can embed any editor in grid cells to format and edit cell data in a specific manner.

- Data Binding — You can bind the control to an IList, IBindingList, DataTable or any IEnumerable data source.
- Data Sorting — Allows you to sort data against an unlimited number of columns.
- Data Grouping — The data grouping feature combines rows with identical column values into the same data groups. You can group the control's data against multiple columns.
- Styles — Allow you to customize the appearance settings of the control's elements in various states.
- Data Edit Operations — A user can edit cell values if data editing is enabled. You can embed Eremex and custom editors in cells to edit and present cell values in a specific manner.
- Data Validation — The validation mechanism helps you check a user's input and data source's values, and show errors in cells.
- Built-in and Custom Context Menus.
- Unbound Columns — You can add unbound columns (those that are not bound to data source fields) and populate them with data manually, using an event.
- Column Resize and Move Operations.
- Search Panel — Helps a user quickly locate rows by the data they contain.
- Auto Filter Row — A special row that allows a user to filter data against columns.
- Row Drag-and-Drop - A user can drag a row within the control and to another control.
- Column Bands — Allow you to visually group multiple columns under a common header.
- Column Header Templates – Allow you to display custom content in column headers, including images.
- Multiple Row Selection (Highlight) — You can enable multiple row selection mode to allow a user to select (highlight) multiple rows at one time.
- Data Annotation Attribute Support — The DataGrid control takes into account dedicated Data Annotation attributes applied to the data source's properties. You can use Data Annotation attributes to specify custom visibility, position, read-only state, and display name for auto-generated columns.
- High Performance for Large Volumes of Data — The data virtualization mechanism for vertical and horizontal scrolling boosts the control's performance when displaying large numbers of rows and columns.
