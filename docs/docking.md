# Docking UI

The **Dock Manager** component shipped as part of the Eremex Avalonia Controls library allows you to implement the classic docking UI found in popular IDEs. You can create tool panels that support dock, auto-hide, and float operations. Special Document containers are designed to display the main content of your window. You can create multiple Documents and combine them in a tabbed UI.
