# Editors

The Eremex Controls library includes multiple editors that provide advanced data editing capabilities. The editors allow you to display and edit data of different data types (numeric, Boolean, date-time, enumerations, etc.). They support the data validation mechanism to inform users about errors during data input.

You can embed the Eremex data editors in cells in container controls (Data Grid, Tree List, Property Grid, and Toolbars/Menus) to present and edit cell data. Any custom control can be embedded in container control cells, but the use of Eremex in-place editors allows you to deliver high-performance UI/UX designs.
