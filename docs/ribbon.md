# Ribbon

The **RibbonControl** control allows you to create a ribbon UI inspired by Microsoft Office products. The control supports two views - Classic and Simplified, which arrange items in three and one row, respectively. A user can switch between them with a dedicated view selection button.

The Ribbon control's main features include:

- Classic and Simplified views
- Support for all types of items (commands) available in the [traditional menus](toolbars.md): regular buttons, check buttons, editors, labels, sub-menus and button groups.
- In-place and popup item galleries
- Quick Access Toolbar - A user can add frequently used commands to this toolbar at runtime from a context menu.
- Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar position (above or below the Ribbon command panel) and visibility
- Displaying items in the tab header area
- Tab header colorization (allows you to highlight contextual tabs)
- Ribbon item navigation with the keyboard
- Adaptive layout of groups and items (adjusts the layout of commands when the Ribbon control's width changes)
