# Heatmap

The **Heatmap** control visualizes numeric data in a matrix using color. Heatmaps are useful for visual analysis of large datasets and locating correlations and anomalies across two variables displayed along the horizontal and vertical axes. 
The color of each data point in a heatmap is determined by the point's numeric value.
